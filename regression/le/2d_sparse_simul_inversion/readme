The files in this regression test folder show how to 
extract data from a high-fidelity simulation, add noise to it, and 
create a mesh for the inverse problem that contains the data and 
a sparsity pattern. 

The input files for the high-fidelity simulation are not present, but
the exodus field containg the data is "clean_data.exo".

The problem was solved on a unit square domain with a fixed bottom,
traction-free sides, and a special traction BC on the top:
t_x = -0.10*x
t_y = -10*x*(1-x)
The shear modulus field is a piecewise-constant ellipse-shaped inclusion,
and can be visualized by looking at the target_le2 field.

The save_sensor_data.py file is run with pvpython and is used to sample
the data at the element centers of a 20x20 mesh.

The create_mesh_2d.py file generates an exodus mesh for inversion. This
mesh has element fields that contain sensor numbers, locations, and values.

In the inversion, the vector traction BC on top and the shear modulus
in the domain are solved for simultaneously.
