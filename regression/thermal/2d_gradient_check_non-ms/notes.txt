This problem and its multiscale version are present for verification
of the gradient computation in a steady-state thermal problem.

The BCs for this problem are homogenous Dirichlet, and the target 
temperature field is sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y).

Therefore, the optimal source term is 2*pi^2*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y).

The optimization parameter is a coefficient p that multiplies
the correct source term, thus the optimal solution is p = 1.0.

With an initial guess of 0 for p, the temperature field is 0 everywhere
and the adjoint field is 1/(2*pi^2)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y).

The exact values of the objective function and its gradient at this
iteration are 0.125 and 0.25, respectively.

The mortar solution finds a value of p that is closer to the optimal value,
which suggests that the gradient is being computed correctly.

However, the mortar version of the problem does not appear to pass the
finite difference test as well as the non-ms version does. To observe this,
turn on the FD check in input_rol2.xml and compare.
