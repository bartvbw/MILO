Cubit tips and tricks:

(see {2d,3d}_uniaxial_tension examples in linearelasticity)

1. Journal files (*.jou) execute cubit commands. They can be converted
to python scripts.

2. There are several useful command line utilities in the
seacas module. Type "module load seacas" to make them available, or
alternatively you canrun these commands from the bin
folder of your trilinos installation directory.

  - decomp: decomposes a mesh so that MILO can run in parallel

    example usage:
      > decomp -p 4 cube.g
      > mpiexec -np 4 ./milo-ms

  - ejoin: combines non-overlapping exodus files into a single file.
    This is useful for combining subgrid data that was generated on 
    multiple processors.

    example usage: (assuming four processors were used)
      > ejoin -output output.exo.4.0 subgrid.exo.0.*
      > ejoin -output output.exo.4.1 subgrid.exo.1.*
      > ejoin -output output.exo.4.2 subgrid.exo.2.*
      > ejoin -output output.exo.4.3 subgrid.exo.3.*


  - exotxt: converts an exodus file to a text file. Can be useful for 
    sanity checks. The inverse of this commmand is txtexo.

    example usage:
      > exotxt tiny.g tiny.txt
