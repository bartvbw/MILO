Instructions for updating from gcc 4.1.2 to gcc 4.9.2

1.  Download and untar gcc-4.9.2.tar.gz.  Throughout these notes we will refer to this directory as gcc-4.9.2

2.  Download gmp-6.0.0a.tar.bz2, mpc-1.0.1.tar.gz, mpfr-3.1.2.tar.bz2

3.  Untar each of these packages into gcc-4.9.2

4.  Remove the numbers from each of these directories (gmp, mpc, mpfr).  gcc will build each of these packages
    for you if they are in the gcc directory and named properly.

5.  Create a build directory (e.g., gcc-4.9.2/build)

6.  cd into build directory

7.  Type "../configure"

8.  Type "make"

9.  Type "make install".  This will install the libraries into /usr/local/lib64

10. Make sure /usr/local/lib64 is in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (see ~/.bashrc file)
